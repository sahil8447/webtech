    <h1>QUESTION BANK ANSWERS </h1>
     <h3>VERY SHORT TYPE </h3>
     <h6>Q1: What do you mean by copolymer and give two examples?</h6>
     <p>ANS: A copolymer is a polymer derived from two or more different monomers. example polythene , teflon</p>
     <h6>Q2 : Define the term polymerization.</h6>
     <p>ANS: Polymerization is a chemical process in which small molecules called monomers are chemically linked together to form long-chain molecules known as polymers.</p>
     <h6>Q3 : Define Molecular orbital</h6>
     <p>ANS :A molecular orbital is a mathematical function describing the wave-like behavior of an electron in a molecule. </p>
     <h6>Q4 : Why graphite is a good conductor of electricity</h6>
     <p>ANS: Graphite is a good conductor of electricity due to its unique molecular structure and the presence of delocalized electrons</p>
     <h6>Q5 : Define water hardness in terms of mineral content</h6>
     <p>ANS :Water hardness is a measure of the mineral content, specifically the concentration of dissolved calcium and magnesium salts, present in water </p>
     <h6>Q6 :Name one method used to soften hard water </h6>
     <p>ANS : reverse osmosis </p>
     <h6>Q7 :What are organometallic compounds? </h6>
     <p>ANS : Organometallic compounds are defined as compounds containing a covalent bond between a carbon atom and a metal.</p>
     <h6>Q8 : What is corrosion?</h6>
     <p>ANS :Corrosion is the gradual deterioration of metals caused by the action of air, moisture, or a chemical reaction (such as an acid) on their surface </p>
     <h6>Q9 : What is cement composed of?</h6>
     <p>ANS :calcium, silicon, aluminum, iron </p>
     <h6>Q10 : What is a fuel?    </h6>
     <p>ANS : Fuels are materials that are burnt to produce a large amount of heat energy</p>
     <h6>Q11 :What is the main difference between temporary hardness and permanent hardness? </h6>
     <p>ANS :Temporary hardness is caused due to presence of bicarbonates of calcium and magnesium and it can be removed by prolonged boiling of water. While permanent hardness is caused due to presence of chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium. It cannot be removed by prolonged boiling of water. </p>
     <h6>Q12 : What is functionality of monomer?</h6>
     <p>ANS :The functionality of a monomer means the number of bonding sites present in it </p>
     <h6>Q13 :What are insulators? Give examples </h6>
     <p>ANS :Materials that do not allow electricity to pass through them are called insulators. examples glass, air, wood, plastic and rubber. </p>
     <h6>Q14 :Write the full form of SWNT and MWNT.</h6>
     <p>ANS : Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs)</p>
     <h6>Q15 :Name two ions responsible for water hardness. </h6>
     <p>ANS : calcium and magnesium </p>
     <h6>Q16 : Name one chemical used in the lime-soda method for water softening.</h6>
     <p>ANS :lime (calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2)  </p>
     <h6>Q17: What are Homo-polymer and Co-polymer?</h6>
     <p>ANS: If a polymer consists of only one kind of monomers then it is called a homopolymer, while a polymer which consists of more than one kind of monomers is called a copolymer.</p>
     <h6>Q18 :What is Plaster of Paris made of? </h6>
     <p>ANS :Calcining Gypsum.  </p>
     <h6>Q19 : What are lubricants?</h6>
     <p>ANS: Lubricant is a substance used to reduce friction between surfaces in contact which reduces heat generated when the surfaces move</p>
     <h6>Q20 :Name three types of fossil fuels. </h6>
     <p>ANS: Coal, oil, and natural gas</p>
     <h6>Q21 :Write the name and chemical structure of monomer of natural rubber. </h6>
     <p>ANS:2-methylbuta-1,3-diene.. </p>
     <h6>Q22 :Define degree of polymerization. </h6>
     <p>ANS:The degree of polymerization (DP or Xn) is defined as the number of monomer units in the polymer.</p>
     <h6>Q23: What are fullerenes? Name the most common fullerene.</h6>
     <p>ANS: Fullerenes are molecules. of carbon atoms with hollow shapes.example Buckminster fullerene  </p>
     <h6>Q24 :Write one example of liquid crystal. </h6>
     <p>ANS:  tobacco mosaic virus.</p>
     <h6>Q25 : How does water hardness affect boiler efficiency?</h6>
     <p>ANS: Hard water, which contains minerals such as calcium and magnesium, can corrode the tubes of water boilers</p>
     <h6>Q26 :Name two types of lubricants. </h6>
     <p>ANS:  oil and grease</p>
     <h6>Q27 :Name one application of cement. </h6>
     <p>ANS: Cement is mainly used as a binder in concrete</p>
     <h6>Q28 :What is biogas? </h6>
     <p>ANS: Biogas a renewable fuel that's produced when organic matter, such as food or animal waste, is broken down by microorganisms in the absence of oxygen. </p>
